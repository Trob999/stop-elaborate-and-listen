# Stop, Elaborate, and Listen

A browser extension + local AI backend that lets you double-tap the spacebar on any YouTube video to pause playback and instantly get a contextual explanation of the last few captions, powered by a local LLM.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed (`go version` should show 1.18 or higher)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed and running locally
- A Chromium-based browser (Chrome/Edge) or Firefox with developer mode enabled

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Local Language Model (LLM)

This project assumes you are using **Ollama3** locally on port `11434`.

```bash
# Install the LLaMA 3 model (once only)
ollama pull llama3

# Start the model (keep this running)
ollama run llama3
```

You should see something like:

```
Ollama is running on http://localhost:11434
```

### 2. Run the Go Server

Navigate to the root of the project and start the backend:

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

Expected output:

```
üöÄ Server listening on http://localhost:8080
```

> Ensure this server is running before using the extension.
