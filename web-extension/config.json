Use the following video metadata to inform your answer:\n- Title: {video_title}\n- Description: {video_description}\n- Hashtags: {hashtags}\n- Channel: {channel_name}\nGiven the transcript from this video, focus on identifying any jargon or specialized terms that appear near the end of the transcript, as these are most likely what the user wants clarified. Provide clear, concise explanations or definitions for these terms, integrating them naturally into your response. Avoid explicitly listing or announcing the jargon termsâ€”just explain them in context, as if helping a peer understand the material. Keep your tone approachable and avoid repeating the user's question or the transcript verbatim.\n"
